# As the new semester begins, the department is offering free ice cream
# for every student, but they don't want any students have more than 1 ice cream,
# because there is limited amount of ice cream. However, bad thing happens. There is
# a student, who managed to eat 2 ice creams. The department wants you to design
# an algorithm to find the name of the student, and in return you will get an extra ice
# cream. Given an array of names your job is to find the name of the student, who had
# 2 ice creams. Give the worst case running time of your algorithm using big-Theta notation. (You
# may use any algorithm presented in class.)
